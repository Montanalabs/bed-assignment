# Bed-assignment agent

Untrusted input is a request; it can only ever become one of a fixed set of decisions over a
closed type, never a tool argument. An injected instruction cannot be represented in the
closed type, so it is rejected — proven at compile time by `check`, and clamped again at
run time by the `extract` domain check.

- **Untrusted input:** `fetch<web>` — a request
- **Closed type:** `type Decision = AssignBed(Ward) | Waitlist` where `Ward` is closed
- **Sink / capability:** `grant assignBed` → `privileged { assignBed(d) }`
- **Consequence axes:** Trust

## Run the demo

```sh
examples/apps/bed-assignment/demo.sh
```

The safe agent proves `SAFE`, runs on a benign input, and **rejects an injection
payload at the trust boundary (exit 3)**. The vulnerable version proves `UNSAFE` — it
never compiles to a runnable agent.

## Files

- `bed-assignment_safe.eide` — the correct design.
- `bed-assignment_unsafe.eide` — the tempting-but-wrong version (the negative example a model must learn to reject).
- `eidos.toml` — the project manifest (each app is a self-contained Eidos project).
